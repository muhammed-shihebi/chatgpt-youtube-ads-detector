[0] Zoro has felt like an outlier in the
[4] monster Trio alongside Luffy and Sanji I
[7] know that sounds weird but Luffy is the
[9] son of dragon grandson of GARP grew up
[11] with the son of the pirate king and so
[13] on and so forth Sanji is a prince of a
[15] scientific military Kingdom has had
[17] intense training from childhood along
[18] with his superhuman Brothers to become a
[20] formidable Soldier and he was also
[22] trained by a relatively renowned martial
[24] artist like zeph their background and
[26] environment someone already sets them up
[28] to be something significant in the
[29] future just through the people they met
[31] Zorro on the other hand in the one piece
[34] World in our own world everyone has
[36] dreams and for some of those dreams
[37] influence matters I mean what would big
[39] news Morgans have to do all day if no
[41] one checked into his newspapers and with

[72] off your first purchase of a website or
[74] domain Zorro on the other hand for a
[77] long time has just been a Rowdy orphan
[78] boy that traveled around picking fights
[80] with Swordsmen and dojos now while
[82] that's also pretty uncommon to be where
[84] he is now with that background is pretty
[86] impressive until we found out about his
[88] lineage in wano now with the recent SBS
[90] in some Revelations it appears to be
[91] that Zorro is a direct blood descendant
[94] of ryuma the sword god making his
[96] current power level and future greatness
[98] nothing short of fate or is it to talk
[101] about the origin of Zora's power in the
[103] way to one piece world is built you have
[104] to talk about the character's
[106] personality and Ambitions because
[108] conviction in this world directly
[110] translates to more powerful hockey and
[113] battle strength something that Otis
[114] surprisingly tried to hammer in yet fans
[116] never being able to fully grasp is the
[118] lack of importance of lot what do I mean
[121] by that well even if we were to go
[122] symbolically it's always the person who
[125] raised you and loved you who is hailed
[126] as the real parent think of Bella mayor
[128] and Nami nojiko think of zephan Sanji
[130] think of who Luke calling Chopper his
[132] son the idea of the child not bearing
[134] the sins of his parents simply by blood
[135] relation like with Roger and Ace in the
[138] case of Sanju and judge and zeph which
[139] both were present in sanji's life the
[141] story recognizes the adopted father as
[144] the more worthy and legitimate father
[146] and even if we take this literally blood
[147] or genetics almost never play a role in
[150] a character strength unlike other shows
[152] like Naruto even Dragon Ball where
[154] characters are naturally born with
[156] abnormal powers specifically related to
[158] their bloodline chiha Sharingan Uzumaki
[160] massive chakra sayin superhuman Etc now
[163] as the Pinnacle of strength kaido
[164] himself put it the world of one piece is
[166] convenient and fair like that to reach
[168] the top you need exceptional hockey
[170] which is directly tied to your personal
[171] training and willpower I know it's a bit
[173] weird calling kaido the Pinnacle after
[174] what happened in a recent chapter but
[176] bear with me in one piece you can have
[177] average humans give birth to wildly
[179] strong characters like big mom with her
[181] parents Sabo and his parents doflamingo
[183] and his parents law and his parents and
[184] so on and so forth while also having
[186] strong characters with much weaker
[188] Offspring like big mom with many of her
[190] kids yasop you know with Usopp Captain
